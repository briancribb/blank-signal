# The Blank Signal
An assistance request app which helps city employees determine which superhero to summon in a crisis. The resulting superhero will have their logo placed over the city's legacy communications system, a.k.a. the large spotlight on the roof of City Hall.

This will be built with Angular as a fun learning project. Hopefully it will also be funny.

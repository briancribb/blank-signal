# The Blank Signal
An assistance request app which helps city employees determine which superhero to summon in a crisis. The resulting superhero will have their logo placed over the city's legacy communications system, a.k.a. the large spotlight on the roof of City Hall. Basically a data-sorting experiment that will hopefully be good for a few laughs as well.

This ia a React project, but it might have an Angular version at some point in the future.
